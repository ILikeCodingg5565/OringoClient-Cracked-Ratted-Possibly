# Running
add -noverify to your JVM args

# Note:
Me (PeterDev) and John were checking the client files and we saw something about discord webhook shit, we don't rlly know if it is a rat but still, kinda sketchy sketchy. Use it at your own risk, we are not responsible for anything that happens to you.

(if it is a rat, we are going to remove it, tell you guys and make an "exposed" video :sunglasses:)
